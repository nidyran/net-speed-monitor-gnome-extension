  "description": "This extension helps tracking and monitoring network speed. \nThere are five modes: \n1 - download speed only. \n2 - upload speed only. \n3 - download speed and upload speed together. \n4 - download speed and upload speed summed. \n5 - total data usage \nTo switch between modes, use left mouse click. \nTo switch between available sources, use right mouse click. \nTo change refresh time 200 - 1000 use middle mouse click. \nThe first source with usage higher than zero will be picked by default. \nThe extension will pick the first source by default, and if no traffic is established it will switch to the next one and so on\nThe source code is available in the link below, update requests are welcome.",
